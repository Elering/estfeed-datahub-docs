## Introduction

Elering ensures that only parties with the respective right arising from legislation or to whom a market participant has granted the respective right are able to access the information of the market participant in the Datahub.

The general principles of access rights are as follows:

1. All electricity undertakings and energy service providers requesting access to the information of a market participant must enter into an agreement with Elering in order to access the information in the Datahub.
2. The customer of a grid agreement is granted access to the data transmitted via the customer portal. The customer has the right to transmit data regarding their metering point and metering data to other persons and systems by means of granting the relevant authorisation.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note! All data relating to natural persons (including EICs) are personal data and subject to the GDPR. Each user of the Datahub is responsible for having a legal basis for performing requests, which also means that a metering point request is permitted only for the purpose of fulfilling the verification obligation provided for in the Network Code on the Operation of the Electricity Market. All consumers can submit complaints and inquiries to Elering about the requests made by market participants, and the person making an inquiry/request must prove the legal basis for processing the customer’s data.

## Registration and access rights of electricity undertaking and energy service providers

Once an electricity undertaking or energy service provider has **entered into an agreement with Elering to access data**, the latter will register the company and determine the access rights. Each type of electricity undertaking is differentiated with its own role abbreviation and has access rights based on their role arising from legislation. Please note! Open suppliers do not have the default rights given to grid operators and grid operators do not have the rights of open suppliers, which means that the role of every electricity undertaking is separately determined (a grid operator can have several roles).

| Datahub user type | Abbreviation | Description | Open supply portfolio agreement obligation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grid operator | GO | Own code range. Responsible for transmitting the technical data, information on grid agreements and metering data of the metering points in its grid area. | Yes. Upon the absence of a agreement, Elering will enter it in the open supplier portfolio of the superior grid operator. |
| Line operator | LO | Own code range. Responsible for the collection and transmission of information related to its metering points and metering data. | No. Not included in balancing – open supply agreements are not added to line operator metering points. |
| Closed distribution network | CDN | Own code range. Responsible for transmitting the technical data, information on grid agreements and metering data of the metering points in its grid area. | Yes. |
| Producer operator | PO | Own code range. Responsible for the collection and transmission of information related to its metering points and metering data. | No, not included in balancing – open supply agreements are not added to PO metering points. |
| Charging point operator | CO | Own code range. Responsible for the collection and transmission of information related to its metering points and metering data. | No, not included in balancing – open supply agreements are not added to CO metering points. |
| Open supplier | OS | Open suppliers transmit the information on open supply agreements entered into with market participants and also the portfolio agreement if they provide open supply services to another open electricity undertaking. | Yes. In the absence of an open supply agreement, the agreements entered into by an open supplier with a market participant are rendered null and void.|
| Aggregator | AGR | Own code range. Aggregators enter the information on aggregation agreements entered into with market participants and transmit the data on consumption management. | Yes. In the absence of an open supply agreement, the agreements entered into by an aggregator with a market participant are rendered null and void.|
| Energy service provider | ES | Energy service providers receive access to information only on the basis of the access rights granted by end-users. | No – the role has access to data only on the basis of access rights. |

## Additional open supply roles

The following additional roles are created arising from agreements in relation to open supply services:

| Additional open supplier role | Abbreviation | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Open supply portfolio agreement obligation                                   |

Upon the registration of an electricity undertaking as a user in the Datahub, Elering enters the person provided in the agreement (with the role name ‘admin’) as the person chiefly responsible for the information of the company. The admin of every electricity undertaking is obliged to configure the API and enter/administer other users of their company and their representation rights. Admins create user accounts for the authorised employees in their company and assume the responsibility for managing their access rights.

### Balance responsible party access to data

Balance responsible party is an open supplier at a higher hierarchical level that has **a balance agreement with Elering**. Elering enters the information on the balance agreement in the Datahub. In other matters, the rights and obligations of an open supplier apply to balance responsible party.

**The metering points of the balance area of a balance responsible party are metering points where the balance responsible party of a market participant and the balance responsible party of the grid operator differ in the respective metering point.**

The inclusion of a metering point of a consumer and/or producer in a balance settlement of a balance responsible party has been determined as follows:

| The metering point of the market participant is within the open supply chain of the balance responsible party | The grid operator managing the metering point is within the open supply chain of the balance responsible party | Inclusion of a metering point in the balance settlement of a balance responsible party </br> (+) amounts are added at the metering point </br> (-) amounts are subtracted at metering point at the metering point |
|---|---|---|
| Yes | Yes | No |
| Yes | No | Yes (+) |
| No | Yes | Yes (-) |
| No | No | No |

The inclusion of a border metering point of a grid operator (the point at which electricity from another grid operator enters their grid) in the balance settlement of a balance responsible party has been determined as follows:

| The grid operator is within the open supply chain of the balance responsible party | The open supplier of the grid operator at a higher hierarchical level than the grid operator (the person managing their border metering points) is a balance responsible party | Inclusion of a metering point in the balance settlement of a balance responsible party </br> (+) amounts are added at the metering point </br> (-) amounts are subtracted at metering point at the metering point |
|---|---|---|
| Yes | Yes | No |
| Yes | No | Yes (+) |
| No | Yes | Yes (-) |
| No | No | No |

A balance responsible party has access to the following information:

| Access to information | Balance responsible party with a future agreement | Balance responsible party with a valid agreement | Balance responsible party with a agreement that expired within a period of up to 12 months | Datahub role | Description |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Metering points of a market participant that are included in the open supply area via the named supplier role: customer EIC, metering point EIC, parties, start times and end times of the related agreements | YES, during the validity of agreement | YES, during the validity of agreement | YES, during the validity of agreement | Automated administration of open supply chain and data exchange | The role of a named supplier provides the same rights as an open supplier with a agreement |
