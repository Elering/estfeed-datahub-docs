## Introduction

A joint invoice allows all open suppliers to invoice consumers jointly for both energy supplied and the grid service.

In order to use the joint invoice service, the open supplier and the grid service provider enter into a joint invoice agreement which sets out the conditions for the implementation of joint invoices. Only the fact that the agreement has been entered into needs to be transmitted to the Datahub. The exact terms of the agreement are not transmitted.

After the entry into a joint invoice agreement, the grid service provider may send a network invoice to the open supplier using the services described in [Joint invoice](14-yhisarve.md).

## Transmitting joint invoice agreements

Only the grid operator can transmit a joint invoice agreement to the Datahub.

The intended process for using agreement services is described in [Agreements](06-agreements.md). The following describes the additional actions of the Datahub related to joint invoice agreements:

- The Datahub makes the information of new or changed joint invoice agreements available to the open supplier (using the `data-distribution/search` service)
