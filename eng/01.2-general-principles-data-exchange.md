## Introduction

The automatic information change (API) between the Datahub and the customerâ€™s information system is done using a REST interface. Systems use JSON format to exchange information.

## Environments

Datahub web application:

- [Test environment](https://public-test-datahub.elering.ee/login)
- [Live environment](https://datahub.elering.ee/login)

Datahub API endpoints:

- Public test environment:
    - Data Distribution API-s: `https://public-test-dd-datahub.elering.ee`
    - Reporting API-s: `https://public-test-rpt-datahub.elering.ee`
    - All other API-s: `https://public-test-datahub.elering.ee`
- Live environment:
    - Data Distribution API-s: `https://dd-datahub.elering.ee`
    - Reporting API-s: `https://rpt-datahub.elering.ee`
    - All other API-s: `https://datahub.elering.ee`

## General rules

- Mandatory attributes (marked with an asterisk) must always be included. In the absence of an attribute, the message cannot be processed and will not be accepted at the receiving end.
- Some attributes are only mandatory in certain cases. If it is so, the relevant indication can be found in the description of the message or attribute or in these documents.
- If an attribute is not mandatory, it may be left out.
- The default encoding used for messages is UTF-8.

## API headers rules

In general, different libraries automatically compose HTTP message headers, but Datahub requires some additional headers that must be set using the API interface:

| Header attribute name     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                   | Example                                        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization             | JWT token obtained during authorization. Read more about authorization on the page [Authentication and authorization](03-authentication-and-authorisation.md) | "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSl..." |
| x-document-identification | Unique UUID of the message. Must be different for each message. Must match the UUID format                                                                    | "dc8bbc4c-c021-4dc5-a5be-ead707e1dcfc"         |
| x-document-date-time      | Message creation timestamp in ISO-8601 format                                                                                                                 | "2024-11-27T07:56:53.075377+00:00"             |

## Date and time submission rules

- All dates and times are submitted in [ISO-8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. The system supports both UTC and time zone offsets. Thus, both `2023-04-01T00:00Z` and `2023-04-01T00:00+03:00` are allowed.

## Response codes

The Datahub uses classic REST API response codes. In the event of an error, the system will return information on the cause of the error if possible. Error descriptions are in both human-readable and machine-readable formats.

## Paging

Many services that allow searching for data offer the possibility of paging. By paging, it is possible to limit the amount of data that can be retrieved at once and view the data by pages.
A standard paging section in a request message is:

```json
"pagination": {
  "page": 0,
  "pageSize": 500
}
```

* `page`, i.e. page number starts from 0. With each subsequent request, the value can be increased by 1 and thus data browsing can be performed page by page
* `pageSize` is the maximum number of entries allowed on one page. Maximum values are documented in Swagger.

Services that enable paging provide information in the response message, which page data is currently displayed (`page`) and how many pages were detected in total (`totalPages`):

```json
"pagination": {
  "page": 0,
  "totalPages": 1
}
```

## General principles of user interface

The other pages and paragraphs contain more detailed guidelines for using the Datahub's user interface. But we recommend to watch the introduction video first: [The new Estfeed data exchange platform user interface workshop, 21.08.2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTClvPhINEg)
