## Introduction

In accordance with business rules, the prior agreement of the relevant market participants is required before entering
into or amending certain agreements. Separate services have been set up for these activities to support the coordination
process.

## Retroactive adding of agreements (changes to start or end date)

### Open supply agreements

Retroactive changes to open supply agreements require coordination between certain market participants. Coordinations
will be collected from everyone at the same time and in parallel. Below are message descriptions, examples and rules.

1. An open supplier enters a request to change the start or end date of an open supply agreement.
2. The request will be sent for coordination to the following market participants:
    - the open supplier of the metering point – only if the customer has an open supply agreement at the metering point;
    - the balance responsible party of the open supplier of the metering point – only if the customer has an open supply
      agreement at the metering point (and the open supplier is not itself the balance responsible party);
    - the general service provider of the metering point (grid operator or named supplier);
    - the balance responsible party of the general service provider (in the case of a supplier only if the supplier is
      not the balance responsible party itself).
3. If the aforementioned approvals and other conditions for switching suppliers are met, the application will be
   assigned to Elering for approval.
4. The change will be applied after approval by Elering.

## Agreement coordination via web interface
