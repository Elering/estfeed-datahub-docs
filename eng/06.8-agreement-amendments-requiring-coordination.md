## Introduction

Separate services have been set up for these activities to support the coordination process.

## Retroactive adding of agreements (changes to start or end date)

### Open supply agreements

Retroactive changes to open supply agreements require coordination between the existing open supplier, the grid operator and the grid operator’s balance responsible party. Coordinations will be collected from everyone at the same time and in parallel. Below are message descriptions, examples and rules.

1. An open supplier enters a request to change the start or end date of an open supply agreement.
2. The request will be sent for coordination to the following market participants:
   - the open supplier of the metering point – only if the customer has an open supply agreement at the metering point;
   - the balance responsible party of the open supplier of the metering point – only if the customer has an open supply agreement at the metering point (and the open supplier is not itself the balance responsible party);
   - the grid operator of the metering point or to a supplier named by the grid operator;
   - the balance responsible party of the grid operator or a supplier named by the grid operator (in the case of a supplier only if the supplier is not the balance responsible party itself).
3. The Datahub confirms the amendment provided that the aforesaid coordinations and other terms and conditions of change of supplier are fulfilled.
