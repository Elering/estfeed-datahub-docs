## Introduction

Information about all added and amended open supply agreements is transmitted to the grid operator in order for the grid operator to be able to monitor when the customer starts using the general service.

Upon the activation of the general service, further data exchange will depend on whether or not the grid operator has a named supplier agreement or not:

- If not, no additional data exchange is foreseen.
- If so, the Datahub will allow the grid operator to send a message to the named supplier that the market participant uses the general service. It is worth noting that for this process, the Datahub is simply a message broker and the use of this interface is optional.

This document describes the service that will be used to notify the named supplier of the activation of the general service.
