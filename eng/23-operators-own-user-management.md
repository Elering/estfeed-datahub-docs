# Operators’ own user management

In order to use the Datahub, operators (persons with input rights, such as grid operators, line operators and open suppliers) must sign an agreement with Elering on the use of the Datahub.

On the basis of the corresponding agreement, the user must inform the system operator in a digitally signed form of its responsible user, the admin, together with the following information:

| Role  | Personal identification code | First name | Last name | E-mail address |
|-------|------------------------------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Admin |                              |            |           |                |

After the entry into the agreement, the user must immediately notify the system operator of any changes to the user’s admin (addition of a new admin, departure of the admin, etc.) by submitting the relevant data in a digitally signed form.

The system operator will create a personal user account for the user’s admin. The admin will create user accounts for the other employees authorised by the user in the web interface of the Datahub.

In the absence of a web interface or in the event of its failure, users are added by the system operator. For this purpose, a list of users and their desired user rights is transmitted to the system operator:

| Market participant role | Type(s) of commodity | User role(s) | Personal identification code | First name | Last name | E-mail address |
|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------|------------------------------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Authorised employee     |                      |              |                              |            |           |                |

If there are any changes in the composition of the user’s authorised employees after the entry into the agreement (a new employee is added, an employee leaves, etc.), the user’s admin will make the corresponding changes regarding access rights immediately after the composition of the user’s authorised employees has changed.

If the user would like the system operator to administer the rights of the user’s authorised employees when using the Datahub, the user will submit to the system operator a list of the employees authorised by the user in a digitally signed form together with the following information:

| Role                | Personal identification code | First name | Last name | E-mail address |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Authorised employee |                              |            |           |                |
